# EQ Programming Language Support
## Add EQ Support to Visual Studio Code
This extension adds support for the EQ programming language (version 2) to Visual Studio Code.
The extension enables support for syntax highlighting and bracket matching, and also adds a new
color theme that matches the existing theme of Eqela App Studio.

To enable the color theme, after installation, simply choose **Preferences** -> **Color** Theme from the
Visual Studio Code menu, and select **"Eqela Green"** as the new color theme.
